Yeah. So richard Feynman was a famous physicist born on May 1119 in Buffalo, New York. One of the things he did was work on the Manhattan Project, which was during World War I, to make the atomic bomb that ultimately ended the war. After that, he went to the California Institute of Technology where he researched quantum mechanics, which eventually won him a Nobel Peace Prize in physics in 1956. But aside physics, Feynman also loved music, especially bongo drumming. But one of the things he was most known for was being an excellent communicator and teacher. His lectures and books were super popular because of how simple they were. And because of this, he gained a devoted following. Unfortunately, Feynman passed away in the February of T 90 H.
